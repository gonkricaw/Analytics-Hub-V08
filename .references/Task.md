# Analytics Hub Development Task List

## Overview

This comprehensive task list provides step-by-step implementation guidance for developing the Analytics Hub web application using Next.js 14, PostgreSQL, and TypeScript. Each task must be completed sequentially with proper verification before proceeding to the next task.

**IMPORTANT RULES:**
- Mark completed tasks with `[√]` and verify all code implementation
- Ensure frontend UI changes are visible after each implementation
- Maintain alignment between Backend, Frontend, Database, and Package dependencies
- Test all functionality locally before proceeding to deployment
- Never skip verification steps or move to next task without completing current one
